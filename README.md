This a project that displays a user's messages from a postgres database.  It is read-only and will only display information already in the database.
The aim of the project was to compare pothos, a declarative code first library to generating typesafe graphql schemas with Nexus.

The project uses:
  - React + Vite
  - Tailwindcss
  - Typescript
  - Pothos: for declarative code first schema generation
  - Graphql-yoga: for the graphql server
  - Prisma: as the ORM
  - Postgres: database
